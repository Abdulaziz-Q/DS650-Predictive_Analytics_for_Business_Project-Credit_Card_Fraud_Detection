### Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection 

Credit Card Fraud Detection is an important problem because customers should not be obliged to pay for purchases, which they have not made. 
Fraudulent transaction conducted on behalf of a genuine customer can be detected on the basis of customerâ€™s spending behavior. 
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a challenging problem due to the variations in spending behavior of customers. 
For example, customers usually spend more on the occasion of public holidays or other religious events.

We are required to develop a classification system that can classify the data into normal and fraudulent categories.
